# About

Personal blog for your's truly. Don't take me too seriously, I sure as hell don't.

## Tech

I'm super good at having grand ideas, implementing a proof of concept, then moving on to the next project. I do my best to see things through but there might be a pattern here. Might as well share the things I hack up.

For work I'm a software engineer in the security R&D space. I've worked at SorceFire acq. Cisco, ISE, Trail of Bits, Google, and now River Loop Security. Research contracts are where I find myself most engaged, so I am very picky about the work I take. Right now I am working part time which leaves plenty of time for side projects.

## Personal

I live in the Bay Area with my partner of 10 years and our dog. We're pretty active. I do body weight exercises, snowboard with my dad, and skate a bit. I've picked up fly fishing but haven't caught anything yet. I have a Wrangler and really enjoy driving slowly on dirt roads.

I follow a strict diet due to some health issues. Changing what I ate really changed my life. I hope to share a bit about that here.

I also meditate. I'm interested in Daoist internal alchemy. Figure it's the best bet on getting super powers in this lifetime. Sitting is hard work though.

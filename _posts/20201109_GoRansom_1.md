Title = "Ransomware in Golang - Part 1"
Description = "Environment and victim directory setup..."
---
## Setup

To get started you’ll need to [download Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and follow the [install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for your operating system. Then you’ll create a directory for this project, I’ll be working out of `~/prog/rw/` where `~` is my home directory on whatever OS I’m working on. 

Golang is cross platform, and we're not doing anything platform specific, so you're free to work wherever you'd like. However, if you're looking to learn some basic skills, now would be a great time to start working with virtual machines! 

I've made some YouTube videos on how to get started with VirtualBox, you can get the links at [cybering.cc](https://cybering.cc/#00). It's super easy, if you can click through two installers, you should have no problem. The videos help through a couple gotchas. So if you're looking to learn about VMs or Linux, both of which are great job skills, give it a shot! Your malware will then be contained in a VM, as all malware should be.

## Victim Directory

Since we will be repeatedly running and debugging our encryptor, we will need to set up a victim directory so we’re not encrypting our own data, especially when we do not have a decryptor! This directory should be replaceable so we can reinitialize it easily. We’ll have a master directory and our directory under test which is an exact clone of it. This way, restoring should be as simple as deleting the directory under test and replacing it with master.

Let’s make `_victim/` and seed it with some data. We’ll have a few requirements. We want to have a handful of files that we can check for validity. When you are decrypting there are small things you can mess up, so we want to make sure our files match their originals exactly. Having multiple file types will also help us when we start filtering by extension. A single flat folder will not be realistic, so we will create a directory structure in order to simulate a real file system traversal.

Yours doesn't have to match mine exactly, but here is a good template structure. 

```
_victim/
	simple.txt
	pics/
		raylan.jpg
		hello.jpg
	docs/
		Resume.pdf
	prog/
		main.go
		main.exe
```

The file `simple.txt` is just a text file that has `Hello world!` in it. In `pics/` I have a picture of my dog and another file I found on the internet. The `docs/` folder contains my resume which I had sitting around.

For the dummy `prog/` folder, we can use this to test our Golang installation. My `main.go` file has the following contents.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Greetings from Go!")
}
```

**Quick Note** We'll be working a lot from the command line. If you're on Linux the provided terminal is great. On Windows, you *can* use command prompt, but I generally work from [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/). If you want to learn some command line basics, I have some videos [here](https://cybering.cc/#01).

Normally, as I'm working I just run my Go files with something like `go run main.go` on the command line. To produce an executable though, we can use `go build main.go`. On Windows this will produce `main.exe`, if you are working on Linux (probably OSX too) you will get an exectuable called `main`, either is fine. 

## Restore and Verify

We're going to create a small utility for restoring our victim directory, and also for verifying that things have been decrypted correctly. Let's make a new directory `~/prog/rw/util`, then create the file `util.go` in there.

### Restoration

Restoration is pretty simple in an OS specific context. On Linux it would simply be `rm -r victim` and `cp _victim victim`. To reliably copy a directory recursively though, there are a lot of edge cases. Thankfully other people have already done the work on this. We're going to use the package `github.com/otiai10/copy`. 

Since `github.com/otiai10/copy` is an external package, in order to import it we will need to run `go get github.com/otiai10/copy` on the command line. That will download the package and store it so we don't get an error like the following when we try to run our util program.

```
util\util.go:5:2: cannot find package "github.com/otiai10/copy" in any of:
        c:\go\src\github.com\otiai10\copy (from $GOROOT)
        C:\Users\tacixat\go\src\github.com\otiai10\copy (from $GOPATH)
```

We'll start with this in `util.go`. Give it a read through and I'll break it down section by section after. You can also try running it with `go run util/util.go`. Try adding on the flags `-verify` and `-restore` to the end of that and seeing how it handles them.

```golang
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"github.com/otiai10/copy"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	restore := flag.Bool(
		"restore", false, "restore victim directory from _victim")
	verify := flag.Bool(
		"verify", false, "verify files in victim directory")

	flag.Parse()

	if !*restore && !*verify || *restore && *verify {
		log.Fatal("Requires one of -verify or -restore.")
	}

	if *restore {
		err := os.RemoveAll("victim")
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		err = copy.Copy("_victim", "victim")
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	} else if *verify {
		log.Fatal("Verify not implemented yet!")
	}
}
```

We start by importing a few packages. In Golang the packages should be listed in alphabetical order. You can do this automatically with `go fmt util/util.go`, which will tidy up other things about the file as well.

* [`flag`](https://golang.org/pkg/flag) - Used for creating command line flags.
* [`github.com/otiai10/copy`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/otiai10/copy) - For copying our `_victim/` directory to `victim/`. Very straightforward package, only one function.
* [`log`](https://golang.org/pkg/log) - We'll use this one for printing instead of `fmt` and I'll explain why below.
* [`os`](https://golang.org/pkg/os) - Used to delete our current `victim/` directory, recursively.

In our `main()` function we start by declaring two flags. The `:=` operator in Go is a short hand for declaring and defining a variable. This could also be done in two steps, like `var restore *Bool` and `restore = flag.Bool(...)` (the `*` here is saying it is a pointer type). The shorthand is nicer. Remember, any assignment after declaration would just use `=`.

```golang
	restore := flag.Bool(
		"restore", false, "restore victim directory from _victim")
	verify := flag.Bool(
		"verify", false, "verify files in victim directory")
```

These are pointers to boolans. Pointers are an address in memory that holds the value (in this case, boolean value). In order to access the value, we dereference it with `*` when accessing the variable.

This block is checking if either both `restore` and `verify` are false or both `restore` and `verify` are true. The `&&` (and) operator has a higher precendence than `||` (or). Think order of operations with `*` and `+`. If we either have both true or neither, we're going to call `log.Fatal(...)` which prints the message and exits the program. 

The `log` package has a very similar format to `fmt`. The primary different is it prints to `stderr` instead of `stdout`, so it useful for program-related messages, rather than those meant for the end user. It also has nice utility functions like `Fatal` so we don't need to call both `fmt.Println(...)` and `sys.Exit(1)`.

*If you need a referesher on boolean logic, check out video [02.04](https://cybering.cc/#02).*

```golang
	if !*restore && !*verify || *restore && *verify {
		log.Fatal("Requires one of -verify or -restore.")
	}
```

If all goes well, and we have run the program with either `-verify` or `-restore` then we'll move onto our if statement. Looking at the second part first, we just bail if we call `-verify`. We'll implement that in a minute.

```golang
	} else if *verify {
		log.Fatal("Verify not implemented yet!")
	}
```

In our restore block we have two actions. The first is calling `os.RemoveAll()` on our `victim/` directory. This will recursively delete (meaning, delete the folder, and all of its contents) the current `victim/` dir. This is great when we have half of our ransomware working and we can encrypt the files but not recover them! 

The pattern of `err = ...` and `if err != nil { ... }` is the standard pattern in Go for handling errors. This is to replace C-style errors where some functions return 0 for OK, and some return NULL (also 0) in error cases. Instead we just get an error, and the if the error is defined, we can handle it. In this case we handle it by printing it out and exiting the program. This is fine since we're not expecting to hit these errors very much.

The next block uses the `github.com/otiai10/copy` package to copy `_victim/` to `victim/`. Easy enough. Only thing to note, is see how we declare and define the first `err` with `:=` and the second we are just reassigning the existing `err` variable with `=`.

```golang
		err := os.RemoveAll("victim")
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		err = copy.Copy("_victim", "victim")
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
```

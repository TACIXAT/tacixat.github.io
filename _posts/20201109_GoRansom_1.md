Description = "Environment and victim directory setup..."
---
## Setup

To get started you’ll need to [download Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and follow the [install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for your operating system. Then you’ll create a directory for this project, I’ll be working out of `~/prog/rw/` where `~` is my home directory on whatever OS I’m working on. 

Golang is cross platform, and we're not doing anything platform specific, so you're free to work wherever you'd like. However, if you're looking to learn some basic skills, now would be a great time to start working with virtual machines! 

I've made some YouTube videos on how to get started with VirtualBox, you can get the links at [cybering.cc](https://cybering.cc/#00). It's super easy, if you can click through two installers, you should have no problem. The videos help through a couple gotchas. So if you're looking to learn about VMs or Linux, both of which are great job skills, give it a shot! Your malware will then be contained in a VM, as all malware should be.

## Victim Directory

Since we will be repeatedly running and debugging our encryptor, we will need to set up a victim directory so we’re not encrypting our own data, especially when we do not have a decryptor! This directory should be replaceable so we can reinitialize it easily. We’ll have a master directory and our directory under test which is an exact clone of it. This way, restoring should be as simple as deleting the directory under test and replacing it with master.

Let’s make `_victim/` and seed it with some data. We’ll have a few requirements. We want to have a handful of files that we can check for validity. When you are decrypting there are small things you can mess up, so we want to make sure our files match their originals exactly. Having multiple file types will also help us when we start filtering by extension. A single flat folder will not be realistic, so we will create a directory structure in order to simulate a real file system traversal.

Yours doesn't have to match mine exactly, but here is a good template structure. 

```
_victim/
	simple.txt
	pics/
		raylan.jpg
		hello.jpg
	docs/
		Resume.pdf
	prog/
		main.go
		main.exe
```

The file `simple.txt` is just a text file that has `Hello world!` in it. In `pics/` I have a picture of my dog and another file I found on the internet. The `docs/` folder contains my resume which I had sitting around.

For the dummy `prog/` folder, we can use this to test our Golang installation. My `main.go` file has the following contents.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Greetings from Go!")
}
```

**Quick Note** We'll be working a lot from the command line. If you're on Linux the provided terminal is great. On Windows, you *can* use command prompt, but I generally work from [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/). If you want to learn some command line basics, I have some videos [here](https://cybering.cc/#01).

Normally, as I'm working I just run my Go files with something like `go run main.go` on the command line. To produce an executable though, we can use `go build main.go`. On Windows this will produce `main.exe`, if you are working on Linux (probably OSX too) you will get an exectuable called `main`, either is fine. 

## Restore and Verify

Restoration is pretty simple in an OS specific context. On Linux it would simply be `rm -r victim` and `cp _victim victim`. To reliably copy a directory recursively though, there are a lot of edge cases. Thankfully other people have already done the work on this.

We're going to use the package `github.com/otiai10/copy`. Let's make a new directory `~/prog/rw/util`, then create the file `util.go` in there.

Since `github.com/otiai10/copy` is an external package, in order to import it we will need to run `go get github.com/otiai10/copy` on the command line. That will download the package and store it so we don't get an error like the following when we try to run our util program.

```
util\util.go:5:2: cannot find package "github.com/otiai10/copy" in any of:
        c:\go\src\github.com\otiai10\copy (from $GOROOT)
        C:\Users\tacixat\go\src\github.com\otiai10\copy (from $GOPATH)
```

We'll start with this in `util.go`. Give it a read through and I'll break it down section by section after.

```golang
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"github.com/otiai10/copy"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	restore := flag.Bool(
		"restore", false, "restore victim directory from _victim")
	verify := flag.Bool(
		"verify", false, "verify files in victim directory")

	flag.Parse()

	if !*restore && !*verify || *restore && *verify {
		log.Fatal("Requires one of -verify or -restore.")
	}

	if *restore {
		err := os.RemoveAll("victim")
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		err = copy.Copy("_victim", "victim")
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	} else if *verify {
		log.Fatal("Verify not implemented yet!")
	}
}
```

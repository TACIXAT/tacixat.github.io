<h1>About</h1>

<p>Personal blog for yours truly. Don&rsquo;t take me too seriously, I sure as hell don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m super good at having grand ideas, implementing a proof of concept, then moving on to the next project. I do my best to see things through but there might be a pattern here. Might as well share the things I hack up.</p>

<p>For work I&rsquo;m a software engineer in the security R&amp;D space. I&rsquo;ve worked at SourceFire acq. Cisco, ISE, Trail of Bits, Google, and now River Loop Security. Research contracts are where I find myself most engaged, so I am very picky about the work I take. Right now I am working part time which leaves plenty of time for side projects.</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>I live in the Bay Area with my partner of 10 years and our dog. We&rsquo;re pretty active. I do body weight exercises, snowboard with my dad, and skate a bit. I&rsquo;ve picked up fly fishing but haven&rsquo;t caught anything yet. I have a Wrangler and really enjoy driving slowly on dirt roads.</p>

<p>I follow a strict diet due to some health issues. Changing what I ate really changed my life. I hope to share a bit about that here.</p>

<p>I also meditate. I&rsquo;m interested in Daoist internal alchemy. Figure it&rsquo;s the best bet on getting super powers in this lifetime. Sitting is hard work though.</p>
